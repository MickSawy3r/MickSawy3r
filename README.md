# About me

Computer Nerd, Android Developer with Flutter Experience, and fun loving person

five years ago, I started android development part time. four years ago, I switched working full-time as an android developer.

During my career, I have worked on multiple projects, stacks and bussiness needs. I mainly implemented Java, Kotlin, and Flutter Code bases.

My contributions have helped my team release many applications; in multiple projects I was the team lead of the apps team. Using tools like dependency injectors, continuous delivery pipelines, RX, multiple software architectures, and domain driven approach we managed to deliver all projects with maintainability and cost-effectiveness in mind.
